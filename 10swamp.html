  <div>
    <p>Strangely, you are now in a primeval swamp, your boots soaked.
      It is as if you have stepped into another world, another time.</p>
    <p>Where am I? You think. What era is this?</p>
    <p>Silhouetted against a dark sky are large creatures, the sounds of their massive wings beating in the night air.</p>
    <p>Something slithers between your boots.</p>
    <p>A foul stench in the air.</p>
    <p>In the distance, a rocky outcropping...</p>
    <p>You will have to pass beneath the winged creatures above to get to it.</p>
    <p>Do you proceed?</p>
    <p>YES or NO</p>
  </div>
