    <p>Dearest Eula,</p>
    <p>I am trapped! They took me in the dead of night and threw me in a four-horse carriage.
      They keep me here in a dank room with a chain around my ankle.</p>
    <p>Though I was blindfolded, I suspect we traveled West for six hours.
      I believe I am held at Abbott Hall, the abandoned manor just outside Wilmaer Wood.</p>
    <p>I know not if the screams I hear nightly are the wailings of the Celtic
      spirits that haunt that old forest, or fellow prisoners whose fate I may soon share.</p>
    <p>My darling, I suspect witchcraft! Scientific experiments! Dealings with the Devil Himself!</p>
    <p>Rescue me, my Love! And bring your pistol.</p>
    <p>Eternally Yours,</p>
    <p>Adrian</p>
