# Abbott-Hall
An Ava Brown Adventure

Dearest Ava,   

I am trapped! They took me in the dead of night and threw me in a four-horse carriage. They keep me here in a dank room with a chain around my ankle.

Though I was blindfolded, I suspect we traveled west for six hours. I believe I am held at Abbott Hall, the abandoned manor just outside Wilmaer Wood.

I know not if the screams I hear nightly are the wailings of the Celtic spirits that haunt that old forest, or fellow prisoners whose fate I may soon share.

My darling, I suspect witchcraft! Scientific experiments! Dealings with the Devil Himself!

Rescue me, my Love! And bring your pistol.

Eternally Yours,

Adrian
