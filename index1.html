    <p id="p1">Dearest Eula,</p>
    <p id="p2">I am trapped! They took me in the dead of night and threw me in a four-horse carriage.
      They keep me here in a dank room with a chain around my ankle.</p>
    <p id="p3">Though I was blindfolded, I suspect we traveled West for six hours.
      I believe I am held at Abbott Hall, the abandoned manor just outside Wilmaer Wood.</p>
    <p id="p4">I know not if the screams I hear nightly are the wailings of the Celtic
      spirits that haunt that old forest, or fellow prisoners whose fate I may soon share.</p>
    <p id="p5">My darling, I suspect witchcraft! Scientific experiments! Dealings with the Devil Himself!</p>
    <p id="p6">Rescue me, my Love! And bring your pistol.</p>
    <p id="p7">Eternally Yours,</p>
    <p id="p8">Adrian</p>
